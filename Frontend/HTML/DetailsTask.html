        school he once studied at, and also took up the same major - computer programming.

        However after graduation, she did not expect that Jiang Yi Cheng's company does not recruit 
        female employees. Lu Li decides to disguise as a man and enter the company. However, 
        she met difficulty both in dealing with Jiang Yi Cheng's demands, as well as hiding her identity. 
        Finally with her perseverance, she grabbed hold of an opportunity and managed to come to an agreement 
        with Jiang Yi Cheng. The two would become a "contract couple" and stay together for one year. 
        Slowly, Jiang Yi Cheng finds himself falling for Lu Li.
