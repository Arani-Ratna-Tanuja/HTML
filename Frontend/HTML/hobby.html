    <h1>My Favorite hobbies</h1>
    <h2>ART</h2>
    <p><strong>One of my favorite hobby is</strong> making<b> paper crafts</b> and <u>watching how these paper crafts are prepared.</u>
    Most of the time <ins>in pandameic period</ins>  i had <em>prepared</em> so many of <b>paper crafts like flower boquet , swan and flowers.</b> 
    For every <mark> vinayaka chavathi festival </mark> i had <mark> umberella</mark> for <mark> lord ganesh myself </mark> for my home and for my grand mother and also for my mother's sister (aunt) also.
    In btech first year for clg fest i prepred <b>Adiyogi lord shiva</b> with <b>clay mud</b>. I had drawn <strong>two pencil sketches</strong> , one is <em>lord krishna</em> another is <em>bird with mandala art.</em></p>
    <h2>Watching Cdramas</h2>
    <p> I like <b> watching Cdramas </b> in my free time. When i was <mark>watching</mark> these dramas there is <mark>no feeling of loniness.</mark>From these dramas i had <b><em>learnt so many things.</em></b>
         <big>These dramas show how the office climate and how the person will treat another person and their bondings.</big>
         I <ins>seen nearly 100 dramas</ins> while watching these if any word that doesn't know to me i had searched mmeaning for these things. All these dramas are seen only in chinese language and understand those by reading the subtitles..
